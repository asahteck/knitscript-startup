Order of development

qs_method.py - quicksort in python
qs.ks - implementing quicksort in knitscript

qs_frame.ks - implementing a frame around a bar chart representing quicksort, but it's vertical
qs_frame_h.ks - frames are now horizontal

qs_frame_def.ks - functions that we can call to generate a stream of horizontal frames

qs_frame_h_color.ks - doing this in a colorwork style by calling functions to prep rows
